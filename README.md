## What is this repository?

This repository, as its name suggests, is for practice.
RiverCat enjoys exploring different things and technologies through hands-on experience.
She has created many practice projects, but they were lost due to annual computer reformatting.
Now, she is determined to preserve these projects as a record, whether for job applications, teaching, or simply reminiscing about past experiences.
